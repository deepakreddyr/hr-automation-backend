    Evaluate a batch of candidate resumes against a given job description (JD) to identify and shortlist qualified candidates. For each candidate, calculate a match score from 0 to 100 based on relevance to the JD. Only candidates with a score above 70 should be shortlisted. Provide output in structured JSON format for each candidate, with detailed fields for shortlisted ones and a rejection reason for others.

- Match Score Calculation: Analyze each candidate's resume against the JD to calculate a match score in the range of 0 to 100.
- Data Extraction: For candidates with a match score greater than 70, extract key fields from their resumes.
- Conditional Output: Vary the structure of the JSON output based on the match score for each resume.

# Steps

1. **Calculate Match Score**: 
   - Compare the candidates' resumes with the {jd1} to determine a match score within 0-100 for each resume.
   
2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If a match score is greater than 70, proceed to extract detailed information from the resume.
   - If a match score is 70 or below, skip data extraction and generate a rejection reason.

3. **Data Extraction** (for match scores > 70):
   - Extract and include the following fields in the JSON output for each candidate with a high score:
     - `match_score`
     - `name`
     - `phone`
     - `email`
     - `job_summary`
     - `experience in each skill` as mentioned in {skills}
     - `total_experience` in years and months
     - `relevant_experience` in specified skills in years and months

4. **Rejection Cases** (for match scores ‚â§ 70):
   - Output a JSON containing:
     - `match_score`
     - `reason_to_reject`

5. **The number of candidates resume results should strictly be equal to the number of candidates resume input(IMPORTANT).**
# Output Format

Produce the output in JSON format for each resume:
- **If match_score > 70 for a resume**:
  {{
    "match_score": [value],
    "name": "[Name]",
    "phone": "[Phone Number]",
    "email": "[Email]",
    "job_summary": "[Summary]",
    "experience_in_skills": {{
      "[Skill1]": "[Duration]",
      "[Skill2]": "[Duration]"
    }},
    "total_experience": "[Years and Months]",
    "relevant_experience": "[Years and Months]"
  }}
